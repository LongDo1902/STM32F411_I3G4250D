I developed a bare-metal, register-level I3G4250D gyroscope driver on STM32F411VET6, using a self-built register-level SPI (no HAL). Then I built a full pipeline to produce stable angular rate and integrated ESTIMATED angles. The firmware verifies WHO_AM_I = 0xD3, performs a soft reboot, configures ODR/BW and full-scale(±245/±500/±2000 dps), and uses both the sensor's internal low-pass and custom software low-pass filters to reduce noise. Raw (1 layer of internal low-pass filter) and filtered (1 layer of software low-pass filters) streams are sent out over UART with DMA; logs are exported (Hercules -> .xls/.csv) and plotted in Python to visualize the software filter's effect.
